IMAGE_SIZE = 64  # instead of 128
```

**3. Webcam Not Working**

```bash
# Test webcam access
python -c "import cv2; print(cv2.VideoCapture(0).read())"

# Try different camera index
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  # instead of 0
```

**4. Streamlit Port Issues**

```bash
# Use different port
streamlit run streamlit_deepfake_app.py --server.port 8502
```
